    "To determine if caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time, we can use a one-sample t-test. This test is appropriate as we are comparing the sample mean to a known value (which is usually the mean reaction time without caffeine, but let's assume it to be a certain value, such as 0.3 seconds, for the sake of this example).\n",

    "Conclusion:\n",
    "Based on this hypothesis test, we can conclude that there is statistically significant evidence at the 90% confidence level to suggest that caffeine does have a significant effect on reaction time, as the average reaction time in the sample (0.25 seconds) is significantly different from the assumed normal reaction time (0.3 seconds)."
