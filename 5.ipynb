    "A confidence interval (CI) is a range of values, derived from sample statistics, that is likely to contain the value of an unknown population parameter. The confidence interval provides an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, the estimated range being calculated from a given set of sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "Confidence Level: Typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 90%, 95%, 99%). A 95% confidence interval, for example, implies that if we were to take 100 different samples and compute a CI for each sample, then approximately 95 of the 100 CIs will contain the true population parameter.\n",
    "Margin of Error: The range above and below the sample statistic. A smaller margin of error indicates a more precise estimate.\n",
    "Calculation of Confidence Interval:\n",
    "The formula for a confidence interval depends on several factors, including the sample size, the level of confidence you want to achieve, and whether you are working with means or proportions. The general formula for a confidence interval for a population mean, when the population standard deviation is known, is:\n",
