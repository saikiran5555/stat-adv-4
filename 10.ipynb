    "To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the new weight loss drug is significantly effective, we can use a one-sample t-test. This test is appropriate since we're comparing the sample mean weight loss to a known value (in this case, we might assume the known value to be 0, representing no weight loss, to test for any significant change).\n",
