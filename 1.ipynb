    "A t-test and a z-test are both statistical methods used to test hypotheses, but they are used in different situations and are based on different assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "T-test:\n",
    "Purpose: Used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups, which may be related in certain features. It is most commonly used when the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "Assumptions: Assumes that the data follows a normal distribution but does not require a large sample size. The t-distribution is used because it better accommodates the uncertainty due to smaller sample sizes.\n",
    "Types: Includes independent two-sample t-test, paired t-test, and one-sample t-test.\n",
    "Usage Scenario: For instance, you want to test whether the means of two independent groups (e.g., control and treatment groups in a medical study) are different. If you have a small sample size (typically less than 30) and you do not know the population standard deviation, a t-test is appropriate.\n",
    "Z-test:\n",
    "Purpose: Used for hypothesis testing when the data is approximately normally distributed. Itâ€™s often used to test hypotheses about a population mean when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "Assumptions: Assumes that the data follows a normal distribution and requires a large sample size. When the sample size is large, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normally distributed, according to the central limit theorem.\n",
    "Types: Includes one-sample Z-test, two-sample Z-test, and Z-test for proportions.\n",
    "Usage Scenario: For example, you want to know if a new teaching method affects student performance. If you have a large sample size (over 30) and you know the population standard deviation, a Z-test can be used to compare the sample mean to the known population mean.\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "T-test: Small sample size, unknown population standard deviation, data follows a t-distribution.\n",
    "Z-test: Large sample size, known population standard deviation, data follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "Example Scenarios:\n",
    "T-test Example: A researcher wants to determine if a new drug significantly affects blood pressure. The researcher tests the blood pressure of 25 patients before and after administering the drug. Since the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown, a paired t-test would be appropriate to compare the means before and after the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-test Example: A company wants to know if a change in their production process has altered the average weight of their product. They have historical data with a known population standard deviation. They sample 100 products after the process change. Because the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is known, a Z-test would be suitable to compare the sample mean weight to the known population mean weight."
