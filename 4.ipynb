    "Bayes's Theorem is a fundamental theorem in probability theory. It describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. The theorem is named after Thomas Bayes (1701–1761).\n",

    "So, even if a person tests positive in this scenario, there is only a 1.98% chance that they actually have the disease. This example illustrates how Bayes's Theorem can significantly adjust our understanding of probabilities, especially in the context of conditional probabilities like medical testing. It highlights the importance of considering the base rate (prior probability) when interpreting the results of such tests."
