    "The margin of error in a confidence interval is a measure of the precision of an estimated population parameter. It specifies a range within which we can expect the true population parameter to fall, with a certain level of confidence. The margin of error is influenced by two main factors: the level of confidence and the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Level of Confidence: The higher the confidence level (e.g., 95% vs 90%), the larger the margin of error, as a wider interval is needed to ensure the parameter falls within that range with higher probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Size: The larger the sample size, the smaller the margin of error. This is because a larger sample gives more information and thus a more precise estimate of the population parameter.\n",
